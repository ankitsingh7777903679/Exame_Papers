The executive acts as a key decision-maker in this process.\n\n○ Operational Oversight: Executives manage daily banking operations, ensuring transactions are processed accurately and on time. For example, they oversee cash management at branches and ATM replenishment.\n\n○ Policy Enforcement: They ensure compliance with Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) norms and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, to prevent fraud and maintain transparency.\n\n○ Credit and Loan Management: Executives evaluate loan applications, assess borrower creditworthiness using tools like CIBIL scores, and approve or reject loans.

For example, it might have funded a textile mill with ₹50 lakh to modernize machinery and resume production.\n\n○ Evolution: In 1985, IRDBI was restructured into IDBI to expand its scope, financing not just reconstruction but also new industrial and infrastructure projects like power plants or highways.\n\n○ Impact: It stabilized industries during downturns, supported job creation (e.g., saving 1,000 jobs in a failing steel plant), and laid the groundwork for modern development banks in India.\n\n○ Current Status: Today, IDBI continues IRDBI’s legacy as a public-sector bank, though its focus has shifted toward commercial banking after partial privatization.\n\n○ Conclusion: IRDBI was a cornerstone of India’s industrial policy, fostering economic resilience and growth, with its influence still evident in IDBI’s operations.",

            "answer": "The Differential Rate of Interest (DRI) scheme is a targeted banking policy in India aimed at promoting financial inclusion and supporting economically weaker sections through subsidized credit.\n\n○ Introduction: Introduced in 1972, DRI reflects India’s commitment to equitable growth by offering loans at concessional rates to priority sectors, contrasting with market-driven interest rates.\n\n○ Concept and Objective: DRI provides loans at a lower interest rate (typically 4% per annum) to groups like small farmers, SC/ST communities, and micro-entrepreneurs, aiming to uplift their economic status.\n\n○ Eligibility Criteria: Beneficiaries must have an annual income below ₹24,000 in rural areas or ₹32,000 in urban areas (as per older norms), ensuring aid reaches the neediest. For example, a farmer earning ₹20,000 yearly qualifies.\n\n○ Implementation: Public sector banks are required to allocate 1% of their total advances to DRI loans. For instance, a bank with ₹100 crore in advances must disburse ₹1 crore under DRI.\n\n○ Benefits: It enables affordable credit access—e.g., a ₹50,000 loan at 4% interest for a small business versus 12% market rate—boosting livelihoods and reducing poverty.\n\n○ Challenges: Low recovery rates, misuse by intermediaries, and lack of awareness limit its impact. For example, only 0.5% of advances might actually reach DRI due to poor targeting.\n\n○ Significance: DRI aligns with social banking goals, supporting schemes like PM Jan Dhan Yojana and rural development initiatives.\n\n○ Conclusion: While DRI is a powerful tool for inclusive growth, its success hinges on effective implementation, monitoring, and awareness to maximize outreach and recovery.",

For instance, a ₹5 lakh overdue loan becomes sub-standard.\n\n○ Legal Notices: Under the SARFAESI Act, 2002, banks issue a 60-day notice under Section 13(2) to defaulters. E.g., a borrower with a ₹20 lakh default is warned before further action.\n\n○ Recovery Mechanisms: Options include loan restructuring (extending repayment tenure), one-time settlements (e.g., settling ₹10 lakh debt for ₹8 lakh), or legal recourse via Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs).\n\n○ Asset Seizure: SARFAESI allows banks to seize and auction secured assets (e.g., a factory worth ₹50 lakh) without court approval if repayment fails post-notice.\n\n○ Wilful Defaulters: IBA identifies wilful defaulters (e.g., those diverting ₹25 lakh loan funds), barring them from credit and escalating recovery via criminal proceedings.\n\n○ Monitoring and Agents: Banks use credit audits and recovery agents for follow-ups, ensuring compliance with RBI’s fair practice code to avoid harassment.\n\n○ Conclusion: IBA rules, aligned with RBI and legal frameworks like IBC, ensure banks recover funds efficiently while maintaining borrower rights, critical for financial health.",
