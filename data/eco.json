      "question": "1. Explain the theory of purchasing power parity.",
      "answer": "Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is a fundamental economic theory that compares the purchasing power of different countries' currencies based on the cost of a common basket of goods and services. It aims to determine the 'real' exchange rate between two currencies. Below is a detailed explanation:\n\n1. Concept and Definition: PPP suggests that in an efficient market with no barriers, the exchange rate between two currencies should equalize the price of an identical basket of goods in both countries. For instance, if a basket costs $100 in the USA and ₹8000 in India, the exchange rate should be 1 USD = 80 INR.\n\n2. Types of PPP:\n   - Absolute PPP: This assumes that the price levels in two countries are directly comparable when expressed in a common currency. It implies perfect price equality after adjusting for exchange rates.\n   - Relative PPP: This focuses on the rate of change in price levels (inflation). It states that the difference in inflation rates between two countries will drive changes in their exchange rates over time.\n\n3. Theoretical Basis: PPP is rooted in the 'Law of One Price,' which states that identical goods should have the same price globally when transportation costs and trade barriers are absent. This ensures that arbitrage opportunities are minimized.\n\n4. Practical Example: If a pair of shoes costs $50 in the USA and £40 in the UK, with an exchange rate of 1 USD = 0.8 GBP, PPP holds because $50 × 0.8 = £40. If this equality doesn’t exist, arbitrageurs could buy cheap in one country and sell high in another, adjusting the exchange rate.\n\n5. Limitations: PPP faces real-world challenges:\n   - Trade Barriers: Tariffs, quotas, and taxes distort prices.\n   - Non-tradable Goods: Services like haircuts can’t be traded internationally, affecting price comparisons.\n   - Transportation Costs: Shipping expenses create price differences.\n   - Market Imperfections: Monopolies or subsidies can skew prices.\n\n6. Applications: PPP is widely used by economists to compare living standards, calculate 'real' GDP across nations, and assess whether a currency is overvalued or undervalued (e.g., The Economist’s Big Mac Index).\n\nConclusion: While PPP provides a theoretical framework to understand exchange rates and price levels, its practical application is limited by external factors. Nonetheless, it remains a critical tool in international economics.",

      "question": "2. Explain the remedies to remove imbalance in the balance of payment.",
      "answer": "The Balance of Payments (BoP) records all economic transactions between a country and the rest of the world. An imbalance occurs when the current account (trade) or capital account shows a persistent deficit or surplus. Below are detailed remedies to correct a BoP deficit:\n\n1. Currency Devaluation: Reducing the value of the domestic currency makes exports cheaper and imports costlier. For example, if India devalues the rupee from 1 USD = 80 INR to 1 USD = 90 INR, Indian goods become more competitive abroad, boosting exports and reducing the trade deficit.\n\n2. Import Restrictions: Governments can impose tariffs, quotas, or import licensing to limit foreign goods entering the country. This reduces import expenditure, improving the current account. However, this may invite retaliation from trade partners.\n\n3. Export Promotion: Policies like subsidies, tax incentives, or marketing support for exporters increase the competitiveness of domestic goods in global markets. For instance, offering tax breaks to textile exporters can enhance foreign exchange earnings.\n\n4. Tight Monetary Policy: Central banks can raise interest rates to attract foreign investment. Higher returns on savings or bonds draw capital inflows, strengthening the capital account. However, this may slow domestic growth.\n\n5. Fiscal Discipline: Reducing government spending or increasing taxes lowers aggregate demand, including for imported goods. For example, cutting subsidies on luxury imports can reduce the outflow of foreign currency.\n\n6. Encouraging Foreign Investment and Aid: Attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) or securing loans from institutions like the IMF can provide immediate funds to cover deficits. For instance, FDI in infrastructure projects brings long-term capital inflows.\n\n7. Exchange Controls: Restricting currency outflows (e.g., limiting how much citizens can spend abroad) preserves foreign reserves. This is a short-term fix but can harm investor confidence.\n\nConclusion: Correcting a BoP imbalance requires a mix of short-term (devaluation, controls) and long-term (export growth, investment) measures. The choice depends on the country’s economic structure, trade relationships, and global conditions.",

      "answer": "The Marginal Efficiency of Capital (MEC) is a key concept in economics, introduced by John Maynard Keynes, representing the expected rate of return on an additional unit of capital investment. Its importance lies in the following aspects:\n\n1. Investment Decisions: MEC guides businesses in deciding whether to invest in new capital goods. If MEC exceeds the interest rate, investment is profitable.\n2. Economic Growth: Higher MEC encourages capital formation, leading to increased production capacity and economic expansion.\n3. Interest Rate Link: MEC connects investment to monetary policy. When interest rates fall below MEC, firms borrow and invest more, stimulating the economy.\n4. Business Cycle Analysis: MEC fluctuates with economic conditions—high during booms, low during recessions—helping explain cyclical patterns.\n5. Resource Allocation: It ensures capital is allocated efficiently, as firms prioritize projects with the highest MEC.\n6. Policy Formulation: Governments use MEC to design fiscal and monetary policies, like tax incentives, to boost investment.\n7. Profit Expectation: MEC reflects entrepreneurs’ optimism or pessimism, influencing aggregate demand.\n8. Dynamic Nature: Unlike static models, MEC accounts for future expectations, making it a forward-looking tool.\n\nConclusion: MEC is crucial for understanding investment behavior, economic stability, and growth, bridging microeconomic decisions with macroeconomic outcomes.",

Widespread Impact: Affects all sectors—production, employment, income, and prices—not just isolated industries.\n4. Self-Correcting: Cycles tend to reverse naturally; booms lead to overproduction and recessions, while troughs stimulate recovery.\n5. Asymmetry: The length and intensity of expansion and contraction phases differ; booms may last longer than recessions.\n6. International Linkages: Trade cycles in one country influence others due to global trade and investment flows.\n7. Investment Fluctuations: Changes in business investment, driven by profit expectations, are a key driver of cycles.\n8. Psychological Factors: Optimism during booms and pessimism during recessions amplify economic swings.\n\nConclusion: These characteristics highlight the dynamic and interconnected nature of trade cycles, essential for economic forecasting and policy-making.",

      "answer": "In economics, 'impact' and 'incidence' refer to different aspects of taxation or economic burden. Their differences are:\n\n1. Definition: Impact is the initial burden of a tax on the person or entity paying it; incidence is the final resting place of the tax burden after shifting.\n2. Point of Application: Impact occurs at the point of tax collection; incidence reflects who ultimately bears the cost.\n3. Example: If a sales tax is imposed on a seller (impact), they may raise prices, passing it to consumers (incidence).\n4. Shifting: Impact is direct and immediate; incidence involves shifting through market mechanisms like price changes.\n5. Economic Entity: Impact affects the payer (e.g., producer); incidence may fall on others (e.g., consumers, workers).\n6. Elasticity Factor: Incidence depends on demand and supply elasticity—e.g., inelastic demand shifts tax to buyers.\n7. Policy Relevance: Governments analyze impact for tax collection efficiency and incidence for fairness and economic effects.\n8. Time Frame: Impact is short-term and visible; incidence is long-term and requires analysis to determine.\n\nConclusion: Understanding impact vs. incidence is vital for designing equitable tax policies and predicting economic behavior.",

      "question": "7. Why is the relationship between the Marginal Saving Propensity (MPS) and the Multiplier inverse?",
      "answer": "In macroeconomics, the relationship between the Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) and the investment multiplier is considered inverse. This means as one increases, the other decreases. This inverse relation can be explained as follows:\n\n1. Definition:\nThe multiplier is a measure that shows how an initial change in investment leads to a greater change in national income.\nIt is given by the formula: Multiplier (K) = 1 / MPS.\n\n2. Role of MPS:\nMPS refers to the fraction of additional income that is saved rather than spent.\nA higher MPS means people are saving more and consuming less.\n\n3. Effect on Multiplier:\nIf people save more, then less money is spent in the economy.\nAs a result, the circular flow of income slows down and national income rises by a smaller amount.\n\n4. Mathematical Explanation:\nAs per the formula K = 1 / MPS, if MPS is 0.2, the multiplier is 5.\nIf MPS increases to 0.5, the multiplier reduces to 2.\nThus, more saving leads to a smaller multiplier.\n\n5. Conclusion:\nThis inverse relationship shows that the power of investment to create income depends greatly on how much people spend (consume) and save.\nTherefore, a lower MPS (higher consumption) leads to a higher multiplier, and vice versa.",

Income Proportion:\nPoor people spend a larger portion of their income on basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter.\nRich people, even though they have higher income, spend a smaller fraction of it because their basic needs are already fulfilled.\n\n2. Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC):\nMPC is higher for poor people because most of their additional income is used for consumption.\nRich people tend to save or invest their additional income.\n\n3. Satisfaction of Basic Needs:\nAs income increases, the need to spend on necessities decreases.\nRich people spend more on luxury goods, which are not bought regularly.\n\n4. Saving and Investment Behavior:\nRich individuals tend to allocate more of their income towards savings, stocks, or real estate.\nPoor people are more focused on meeting immediate consumption needs.\n\n5. Consumption Pattern:\nPoor people's consumption is more reactive to changes in income.\nRich people's consumption remains relatively stable even if their income changes.\n\n6. Conclusion:\nThe poor class has a higher MPC and thus higher consumption behavior.\nThe rich class has lower MPC and higher savings, leading to lower consumption behavior overall.",
