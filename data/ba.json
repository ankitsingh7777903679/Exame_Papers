      "question": "16. Riya and Co. Ltd. makes various biscuits, with its high-quality glucose biscuits in great demand. A 100 gm packet costs Rs. 7.00, but rising production and expenditure prompt management to increase the price by Rs. 3.00 to maintain profit margins. Managers suggest: (1) Immediate Rs. 3.00 increase. (2) Gradual 50 paise increase monthly for six months. (3) Reduce quantity to 80 gm at Rs. 7.00. (4) Cut advertisement and distribution costs. Answer: (1) Which suggestions should be accepted? Why? (2) Which suggestions should not be accepted? Why?",
      "answer": "Riya and Co. Ltd. faces rising costs for its popular 100 gm glucose biscuits, priced at Rs. 7.00, requiring a Rs. 3.00 price increase to maintain margins. The suggestions are evaluated below:\n\n○ (1) Suggestions to Accept:\n  ○ (2) Gradual 50 paise increase monthly for six months:\n    ○ Why: A gradual increase (Rs. 7.00 to Rs. 10.00 over six months) minimizes customer resistance, especially in a price-sensitive market. It allows consumers to adjust, preserving demand for a high-quality, popular product. Gradual changes maintain brand loyalty and reduce the risk of competitors capturing market share.\n    ○ Example: Similar strategies work for FMCG brands during inflation.\n  ○ (3) Reduce quantity to 80 gm at Rs. 7.00:\n    ○ Why: Maintaining the Rs. 7.00 price point while reducing quantity by 20% effectively increases the price per gram without alienating budget-conscious buyers. This subtle adjustment aligns with industry practices (e.g., ‘shrinkflation’) and preserves perceived affordability, protecting sales volume.\n    ○ Example: Many snack brands reduce pack sizes during cost pressures.\n\n○ (2) Suggestions to Reject:\n  ○ (1) Immediate Rs. 3.00 increase:\n    ○ Why: A sudden 43% price hike (Rs. 7.00 to Rs. 10.00) risks shocking customers, particularly in a competitive biscuit market. Price-sensitive consumers may switch to cheaper alternatives, reducing sales and market share. The immediate jump could also harm the brand’s value-for-money image.\n    ○ Example: Abrupt price hikes often lead to backlash in FMCG sectors.\n  ○ (4) Cut advertisement and distribution costs:\n    ○ Why: Reducing marketing and distribution for a high-demand product could weaken its market presence. Advertising sustains brand visibility, while efficient distribution ensures availability. Cutting these risks losing shelf space to competitors and diminishing long-term sales, outweighing short-term savings.\n    ○ Example: FMCG brands rely on consistent promotion to maintain demand.\n\n○ Strategic Considerations:\n  ○ Combining suggestions (2) and (3) could be optimal: start with a quantity reduction to 80 gm at Rs. 7.00, then gradually increase the price later if costs persist. This balances immediate margin needs with customer retention.\n  ○ Monitor competitor pricing and consumer feedback to adjust strategies.\n\n○ Conclusion:\n  ○ Accepting gradual price increases and quantity reduction best maintains profitability while protecting demand. Immediate price hikes and cost-cutting in promotion/distribution are risky and likely to harm the brand’s market position.",

      "question": "27. The workers of Nilkamal Plastics Ltd. are working according to 50 hours per week and getting their pay and commission. The company did not pay over-time, as the daily work was being completed in time. The company paid additional commission to the workers, who worked for more time. \nAs stated by Shri Ramanbhai the leader of the Trade Union, the workers were working even on holidays. More ever, their weekly work was more than 50 hours. So, the union asked for over-time. Company states “It is not the policy of the company to pay over-time”. However, some workers continued to work more than 50 hours per week. The union again asked for over-time pay for them. The company denied. At last,the trade union represented the case before an arbitrator. The arbitrator ordered the company to pay over-time. \n The company called a meeting of all workers and declared that “Henceforth nobody should work for over-time and the company will not pay anything for such work. Those who are not in a position to finish the work in due time, should inform the company, so that company can take necessary action.” \n  Merged: (1) How far is the demand of the trade union proper? (2) Will you accept the judgement of the arbitrator as a company manager? Why? (3) Express your opinion as the leader of the trade union for the final decision of the company.",
      "answer": "This merged response addresses the Nilkamal Plastics Ltd. case, where workers exceed a 50-hour workweek without overtime pay, leading to a trade union demand, an arbitrator’s ruling, and the company’s final decision.\n\n○ (1) Propriety of the Trade Union’s Demand:\n  ○ Context: Workers at Nilkamal Plastics Ltd. work over 50 hours weekly and on holidays, receiving only commissions, not overtime, despite union demands led by Shri Ramanbhai.\n  ○ Legal Basis: The Factories Act, 1948 (Section 51) caps the standard workweek at 48 hours, with overtime pay at double the regular rate for excess hours (Section 59). Holiday work also warrants extra compensation.\n  ○ Evaluation: The union’s demand is fully proper. Exceeding 50 hours and working holidays without overtime violates statutory rights. Commissions don’t replace mandated pay, and the company’s ‘no overtime policy’ is legally invalid against labor laws.\n  ○ Conclusion: The demand is entirely justified, protecting workers from exploitation and aligning with legal entitlements.\n\n○ (2) Acceptance of the Arbitrator’s Judgement as a Company Manager:\n  ○ Arbitrator’s Ruling: Ordered overtime pay for hours beyond 50 weekly, upheld by the union’s case.\n  ○ Managerial Perspective: As a manager, I’d accept the judgement for these reasons:\n    ○ Legal Force: The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (Section 31) makes the award binding; non-compliance risks penalties.\n    ○ Compliance: The ruling aligns with the Factories Act, correcting the company’s illegal practice.\n    ○ Labor Relations: Paying overtime resolves unrest, retaining productivity and trust.\n    ○ Risks of Rejection: Financial burden exists (past dues increase costs), and it sets a precedent, but legal and reputational risks outweigh these.\n  ○ Strategy: Accept the order, pay past overtime, and enforce strict future limits (e.g., 50-hour cap) to manage costs.\n  ○ Example: Settle dues for documented hours, then adjust workloads to avoid recurrence.\n  ○ Conclusion: Acceptance is pragmatic, ensuring compliance and stability while planning cost control.\n\n○ (3) Opinion as Trade Union Leader on the Company’s Final Decision:\n  ○ Company Decision: ‘No overtime work or pay henceforth; inform if work isn’t completed in time for necessary action.’\n  ○ Union Leader’s View (Shri Ramanbhai):\n    ○ Critique: The ban on overtime limits workers’ income potential, ignoring their financial reliance on extra hours. It fails to address past dues, defying the arbitrator’s order, and risks legal escalation.\n    ○ Workload Concern: Assuming 50 hours suffice overlooks production peaks, potentially leading to disciplinary ‘action’ against workers unable to cope, increasing stress.\n    ○ Positive Aspect: It clarifies work limits, reducing overwork if workloads are realistic.\n  ○ Union Response: Demand immediate payment of past overtime per the ruling. Propose voluntary overtime with pay (e.g., 1.5x rate) for peak periods, capped reasonably, and request workload analysis to ensure feasibility.\n  ○ Example Proposal: ‘Pay past overtime at double rate for hours over 48; allow optional 10 extra hours weekly at 1.5x with approval.’\n  ○ Strategy: If unmet, pursue labor court enforcement or strike action.\n  ○ Conclusion: The decision is rigid and unfair; I’d advocate for compensation and flexibility to safeguard workers’ rights.\n\n○ Interconnection:\n  ○ The union’s proper demand triggered the arbitrator’s ruling, which the manager must accept to comply with law and maintain harmony. The company’s decision, however, conflicts with both, prompting the union leader to push back. These perspectives highlight a tension between legal obligations, managerial practicality, and worker welfare, resolvable through compromise (e.g., paying dues and adjusting policies).\n\n○ Overall Conclusion:\n  ○ The union’s demand is legally sound, the arbitrator’s judgement is a managerial necessity, and the company’s decision requires union-led revision to balance fairness, compliance, and operational needs.",
