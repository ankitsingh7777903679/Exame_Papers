The structure consists of the following components:\n\n○ Package Declaration (Optional): If the program belongs to a specific package, it begins with a package declaration. Example: `package myPackage;`\n\n○ Import Statements (Optional): To include libraries or classes from Java's API, the `import` keyword is used. Example: `import java.util.Scanner;`\n\n○ Class Definition: Every Java program is written inside a class. The class name must match the filename (if it is public). Example: `public class MyProgram { ... }`\n\n○ Main Method: The `main` method serves as the entry point for program execution. Its signature is `public static void main(String[] args) { ... }`\n\n○ Variables and Methods: Inside the class, you define variables and methods to perform specific tasks. Example: `int num = 10;`\n\n○ Comments: Comments are added for clarity and do not affect program execution. They can be single-line (`//`) or multi-line (`/* */`)\n\nHere’s an example program that demonstrates the Java programming structure:",

It is achieved by method overriding, typically through inheritance or interfaces. When a class implements an interface and provides implementations for its methods, the actual method that gets executed depends on the runtime type of the object being referred to, not the type of the reference variable. This enables dynamic method dispatch.\n\nInterfaces are used to achieve runtime polymorphism by defining a common method signature that different classes can implement differently.

Threads enhance the efficiency of CPU utilization by enabling parallel execution.\n\nThread Lifecycle:\n\n○ New (Created): A thread begins its lifecycle in the 'new' state when it is created using the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface but hasn't started executing. Example: `Thread t = new Thread();`\n\n○ Runnable: The thread enters the runnable state after the `start()` method is called. It is ready to run and waiting for CPU scheduling\n\n○ Running: When a thread scheduler selects the thread, it moves to the running state, where the `run()` method executes\n\n○ Blocked/Waiting: The thread enters this state if it is waiting for some resource or signal, such as waiting for I/O operations to complete\n\n○ Terminated: The thread ends its lifecycle after completing execution or when it is explicitly stopped",

Packages also make it easier to manage access control and reuse code.\n\nTypes of Packages:\n\n○ Built-in Packages: Java provides several built-in packages like `java.util` (for utility classes) and `java.io` (for input/output operations)\n\n○ User-defined Packages: Developers can create their own packages to organize their classes as per their needs\n\nSteps to Create and Import a Package:\n\n○ Creating a Package: Use the `package` keyword at the beginning of the Java file to specify the package name. Save the file in a folder that matches the package name. Example:\n   ```java\n   package mypackage;\n\n   public class MyClass {\n       public void displayMessage() {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello from MyClass in mypackage!\");\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   Save this file as `MyClass.java` inside a folder named `mypackage`\n\n○ Compiling the Package: Compile the file using the command: `javac -d . MyClass.java`. The `-d .` option creates the package structure in the current directory\n\n○ Using the Package: Import the package in another class using the `import` keyword. Call the methods or access the classes from the package. Example:\n   ```java\n   import mypackage.MyClass;\n\n   public class TestPackage {\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\n           MyClass obj = new MyClass();\n           obj.displayMessage();\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n○ Running the Program: Compile the `TestPackage.java` file.

        "answer": "In Node.js, the 'fs' (File System) module provides methods for interacting with the file system, including reading and writing files asynchronously. Two of the most commonly used methods are fs.writeFile() and fs.readFile().\n\n○ fs.writeFile():\n  o Used to create or overwrite a file with the specified content.\n  o Asynchronous and non-blocking, ensuring better performance.\n  o If the file does not exist, it is automatically created.\n  o Takes three parameters: file path, data to write, and a callback function.\n  o Example usage:\n    fs.writeFile(\"example.txt\", \"Hello, Node.js!\", function(err) {\n      if (err) throw err;\n      console.log(\"File written successfully.\");\n    });\n\n○ fs.readFile():\n  o Used to read the contents of a file asynchronously.\n  o Prevents blocking the execution of other code.\n  o Takes three parameters: file path, encoding (optional), and a callback function.\n  o Example usage:\n    fs.readFile(\"example.txt\", \"utf8\", function(err, data) {\n      if (err) throw err;\n      console.log(\"File contents: \" + data);\n    });\n\n○ Key Differences:\n  o fs.writeFile() is used for writing data to a file, while fs.readFile() is used for reading data.\n  o Both methods are asynchronous and require callback functions.\n  o fs.readFile() requires an encoding parameter (optional) to return a readable string.\n\n○ Use Cases:\n  o fs.writeFile() is used for logging, configuration file updates, or saving user data.\n  o fs.readFile() is useful for reading JSON configurations, template files, or logs.",

These widgets are highly customizable and composable, enabling developers to build beautiful and expressive UIs. Flutter provides pre-built widgets (like `Text`, `Image`, `Container`) and the flexibility to create custom widgets\n\n○ Cross-Platform Development: With a single codebase, Flutter enables the creation of apps for multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop.

        "code": "import java.applet.Applet;\nimport java.awt.*;\n\npublic class ShapeApplet extends Applet {\n    String shape; // Shape name from parameter\n\n    public void init() { // Initialize applet\n        shape = getParameter(\"shape\"); // Get shape from HTML param\n    }\n\n    public void paint(Graphics g) {\n        int centerX = 150, centerY = 150, size = 100; // Center and size\n\n        g.setColor(Color.RED); // Set fill color to red\n        if (shape.equalsIgnoreCase(\"rectangle\")) { // Draw rectangle\n            g.fillRect(centerX - size, centerY - size, 2 * size, 2 * size);\n        } else if (shape.equalsIgnoreCase(\"oval\")) { // Draw oval\n            g.fillOval(centerX - size, centerY - size, 2 * size, 2 * size);\n        } else if (shape.equalsIgnoreCase(\"triangle\")) { // Draw triangle\n            int[] xPoints = {centerX, centerX + size, centerX - size};\n            int[] yPoints = {centerY - size, centerY + size, centerY + size};\n            g.fillPolygon(xPoints, yPoints, 3);\n        }\n\n        g.setColor(Color.BLACK); // Set text color to black\n        g.drawString(\"VNSGU\", centerX - 20, centerY); // Write VNSGU in center\n\n        // Output: A graphical window (300x300 pixels) showing a red filled oval\n        // (if 'oval' is passed in param), with 'VNSGU' written in black at the center.\n        // Shape changes to rectangle or triangle based on the 'shape' parameter value.\n    }\n}\n\n/* HTML: <applet code=\"ShapeApplet\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\">\n    <param name=\"shape\" value=\"oval\">\n</applet> */"
