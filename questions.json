Example: `import java.util.Scanner;`\n\n○ Class Definition: Every Java program is written inside a class. The class name must match the filename (if it is public). Example: `public class MyProgram { ... }`\n\n○ Main Method: The `main` method serves as the entry point for program execution. Its signature is `public static void main(String[] args) { ... }`\n\n○ Variables and Methods: Inside the class, you define variables and methods to perform specific tasks. Example: `int num = 10;`\n\n○ Comments: Comments are added for clarity and do not affect program execution. They can be single-line (`//`) or multi-line (`/* */`)\n\nHere’s an example program that demonstrates the Java programming structure:",

It is achieved by method overriding, typically through inheritance or interfaces. When a class implements an interface and provides implementations for its methods, the actual method that gets executed depends on the runtime type of the object being referred to, not the type of the reference variable.

It is a lightweight subprocess and is part of a multithreaded environment, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently within a program. Threads enhance the efficiency of CPU utilization by enabling parallel execution.\n\nThread Lifecycle:\n\n○ New (Created): A thread begins its lifecycle in the 'new' state when it is created using the `Thread` class or implementing the `Runnable` interface but hasn't started executing. Example: `Thread t = new Thread();`\n\n○ Runnable: The thread enters the runnable state after the `start()` method is called. It is ready to run and waiting for CPU scheduling\n\n○ Running: When a thread scheduler selects the thread, it moves to the running state, where the `run()` method executes\n\n○ Blocked/Waiting: The thread enters this state if it is waiting for some resource or signal, such as waiting for I/O operations to complete\n\n○ Terminated: The thread ends its lifecycle after completing execution or when it is explicitly stopped",

        "answer": "In Java, a package is a way of grouping related classes and interfaces together, which helps in organizing code and avoiding name conflicts. Packages also make it easier to manage access control and reuse code.\n\nTypes of Packages:\n\n○ Built-in Packages: Java provides several built-in packages like `java.util` (for utility classes) and `java.io` (for input/output operations)\n\n○ User-defined Packages: Developers can create their own packages to organize their classes as per their needs\n\nSteps to Create and Import a Package:\n\n○ Creating a Package: Use the `package` keyword at the beginning of the Java file to specify the package name. Save the file in a folder that matches the package name. Example:\n   ```java\n   package mypackage;\n\n   public class MyClass {\n       public void displayMessage() {\n           System.out.println(\"Hello from MyClass in mypackage!\");\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n   Save this file as `MyClass.java` inside a folder named `mypackage`\n\n○ Compiling the Package: Compile the file using the command: `javac -d . MyClass.java`. The `-d .` option creates the package structure in the current directory\n\n○ Using the Package: Import the package in another class using the `import` keyword. Call the methods or access the classes from the package.

        "answer": "Bitwise operators in Java perform operations on individual bits of integer types, such as int and long. They are used for low-level programming, such as working with flags or manipulating binary data.\n\nBitwise Operators:\n\n○ AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation. It returns 1 if both corresponding bits are 1; otherwise, it returns 0. Example: `5 & 3` (Binary: 0101 & 0011) Result: 1 (Binary: 0001)\n\n○ OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation. It returns 1 if either of the corresponding bits is 1. Example: `5 | 3` (Binary: 0101 | 0011) Result: 7 (Binary: 0111)\n\n○ XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR operation. It returns 1 if the corresponding bits are different; otherwise, it returns 0. Example: `5 ^ 3` (Binary: 0101 ^ 0011) Result: 6 (Binary: 0110)\n\n○ Complement (~): Inverts all bits of the number. Each 0 becomes 1 and each 1 becomes 0. Example: `~5` (Binary: ~0101) Result: -6 (Binary for -6 in two's complement: 1010)\n\n○ Left Shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left and fills zeros in the vacant positions. It effectively multiplies the number by 2 for each shift. Example: `5 << 1` (Binary: 0101 << 1) Result: 10 (Binary: 1010)\n\n○ Right Shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right and fills the leftmost positions with the sign bit (0 for positive numbers, 1 for negative numbers). It effectively divides the number by 2 for each shift. Example: `5 >> 1` (Binary: 0101 >> 1) Result: 2 (Binary: 0010)\n\n○ Unsigned Right Shift (>>>): Shifts bits to the right and fills the leftmost positions with 0, regardless of the sign. Example: `-5 >>> 1` (Binary: -5 in two's complement is 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111011; >>> 1) Result: 2147483645",

        "question": "11. Explain JSON Data Types in detail.",
        "answer": "JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based format for storing and exchanging data. It is language-independent but uses conventions from JavaScript, making it easy to read and write. JSON supports a limited set of data types, which are essential for structuring data in a consistent and predictable manner. These data types are used to represent values within JSON objects and arrays.\n\nSupported JSON Data Types:\n\nJSON defines the following six data types, each with specific rules and purposes:\n\n○ String: Definition: A sequence of zero or more Unicode characters enclosed in double quotes (`\"...\"`). Characteristics: Supports escape sequences (e.g., `\\\"`, `\\n`, `\\t`), is case-sensitive, and immutable. Example: `\"Hello, World!\"`, `\"123\"`, `\"user@example.com\"`. Use Case: Representing text data such as names, emails, or messages\n\n○ Number: Definition: A numeric value that can be an integer or a floating-point number. Characteristics: No distinction between integer and float, supports negative values and exponential notation (e.g., `1.5e3`), does not support octal or hexadecimal formats directly. Example: `42`, `-17.5`, `3.14159`, `1e-10`. Use Case: Representing quantities, measurements, or identifiers (e.g., age, price)\n\n○ Boolean: Definition: A logical value that can be either `true` or `false`. Characteristics: Case-sensitive; only lowercase `true` and `false` are valid, used to represent binary states. Example: `true`, `false`. Use Case: Indicating status (e.g., `isActive: true`, `isDeleted: false`)\n\n○ Null: Definition: A special value representing the absence of a value or a null reference. Characteristics: Case-sensitive; only lowercase `null` is valid, indicates an intentionally empty or undefined field. Example: `null`. Use Case: Representing missing or uninitialized data (e.g., `lastLogin: null`)\n\n○ Object: Definition: An unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Characteristics: Keys must be strings in double quotes, values can be any JSON data type, key-value pairs are separated by commas with a colon `:` between key and value. Example: `{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 25, \"isStudent\": false}`. Use Case: Structuring complex data like user profiles or product details\n\n○ Array: Definition: An ordered, comma-separated list of values enclosed in square brackets `[]`. Characteristics: Values can be any JSON data type, including nested objects or arrays, order is preserved, can be empty or contain mixed types. Example: `[1, \"two\", true, {\"key\": \"value\"}, [3, 4]]`. Use Case: Representing lists such as a collection of items, scores, or user roles\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n○ No Other Types: JSON does not natively support complex types like functions, dates (though strings can represent dates), or undefined values\n\n○ Interoperability: These types ensure compatibility across languages and platforms when parsing JSON\n\n○ Validation: Tools like JSON Schema can enforce type constraints in data exchange",

        "question": "12. Explain jQuery Events in detail.",
        "answer": "jQuery provides a powerful event-handling mechanism that allows developers to attach and manage events easily. Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as clicks, key presses, form submissions, and mouse movements. jQuery simplifies event binding, handling, and delegation, making event-driven programming more efficient.\n\nTypes of jQuery Events:\n\njQuery categorizes events into several types based on their functionality:\n\nMouse Events:\n\n○ These events are triggered by mouse interactions with elements\n\n○ Common Mouse Events: `click()`: Fires when an element is clicked. `dblclick()`: Fires when an element is double-clicked. `mouseenter()`, `mouseleave()`: Triggers when the mouse enters or leaves an element. `mouseover()`, `mouseout()`: Similar to `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` but bubbles up the DOM. `mousedown()`, `mouseup()`: Fires when a mouse button is pressed or released over an element. `mousemove()`: Fires when the mouse moves within an element\n\nKeyboard Events:\n\n○ These events handle keyboard interactions\n\n○ Common Keyboard Events: `keydown()`: Fires when a key is pressed down. `keyup()`: Fires when a key is released. `keypress()`: Fires when a key is pressed (deprecated, use `keydown` instead)\n\nForm Events:\n\n○ These events handle form interactions\n\n○ Common Form Events: `submit()`: Triggers when a form is submitted. `change()`: Triggers when the value of an input field changes. `focus()`, `blur()`: Triggers when an element gains or loses focus. `input()`: Triggers when a user inputs text into a field. `select()`: Fires when text inside an input field is selected\n\nWindow Events:\n\n○ These events handle interactions with the browser window\n\n○ Common Window Events: `resize()`: Fires when the window is resized. `scroll()`: Fires when the page is scrolled. `load()`: Fires when the page and all assets (images, scripts) are fully loaded. `unload()`: Fires when the page is being unloaded (deprecated, use `beforeunload`). `beforeunload()`: Fires when the user tries to leave the page\n\nEvent Binding Methods:\n\n○ `.on()`: The recommended way to attach events (supports event delegation)\n\n○ `.off()`: Removes an event handler from an element\n\n○ `.one()`: Attaches an event handler that executes only once per element\n\n○ `.trigger()`: Manually triggers an event\n\n○ `.hover()`: A shorthand for `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`\n\nEvent Delegation:\n\n○ Event delegation is useful for dynamically added elements\n\n○ Instead of binding an event to each child element, you bind it to a parent element and use `on()`:\n     ```javascript\n     $(\"#parent\").on(\"click\", \".child\", function() {\n       alert(\"Child clicked!\");\n     });\n     ```\n\n○ This improves performance and ensures events work on dynamically added elements\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\n○ jQuery normalizes event behavior across different browsers\n\n○ Use event delegation for dynamic content\n\n○ Always unbind events when no longer needed to prevent memory leaks\n\n○ Avoid using deprecated event methods like `bind()` and `live()`\n\njQuery events simplify handling user interactions, making it easier to create interactive web applications.",

        "question": "13. Jquery string in Node.js?",
        "answer": "Since jQuery is built for the browser and does not run in a Node.js environment, we use alternative methods for string manipulation in Node.js. A common approach is to use the `Cheerio` library, which provides a jQuery-like syntax for working with HTML strings on the server.\n\nUsing Cheerio in Node.js:\n\nCheerio allows us to parse and manipulate HTML strings as we would with jQuery in the browser.\n\nInstallation:\n\n○ To install Cheerio in a Node.js project, run:\n```sh\nnpm install cheerio\n```\n\nBasic Example:\n\n○ Using Cheerio to manipulate an HTML string:\n```javascript\nconst cheerio = require(\"cheerio\");\n\n// Sample HTML string\nconst htmlString = \"<div id='content'><p>Hello, <strong>Node.js</strong>!</p></div>\";\n\n// Load HTML into Cheerio\nconst $ = cheerio.load(htmlString);\n\n// Manipulate elements like jQuery\n$(\"p\").append(\" How are you?\");\n\nconsole.log($(\"#content\").html());\n// Output: <p>Hello, <strong>Node.js</strong>! How are you?</p>\n```\n\nString Manipulation in Node.js (Without jQuery):\n\n○ For pure string operations in Node.js, you can use built-in JavaScript methods like: `.replace()`: Replaces a substring. `.toUpperCase()`, `.toLowerCase()`: Changes case. `.trim()`: Removes whitespace. `.split()`, `.join()`: Splits and joins strings\n\n○ Example:\n```javascript\nlet str = \"Hello, jQuery in Node.js!\";\nstr = str.replace(\"jQuery\", \"Cheerio\");\nconsole.log(str); // Output: Hello, Cheerio in Node.js!\n```\n\nUsing Template Strings:\n\n○ Template literals (backticks) provide an easy way to format strings in Node.js:\n```javascript\nlet name = \"Developer\";\nlet message = `Welcome, ${name}!`;\nconsole.log(message); // Output: Welcome, Developer!\n```\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhile jQuery itself cannot run in Node.js, Cheerio provides similar functionality for working with HTML strings. For general string manipulation, JavaScript’s built-in string methods are sufficient.",

It is achieved using access modifiers like public, private, and protected.\no Inheritance: Enables code reusability by allowing one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. This reduces redundancy in code.\no Polymorphism: Allows multiple methods to have the same name but different implementations. It can be achieved through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism).\no Abstraction: Hides complex implementation details and shows only the essential features to the user. It is implemented using abstract classes and interfaces."
